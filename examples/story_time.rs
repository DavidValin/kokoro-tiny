                 How peculiar! They searched high and low through Git branches. \
                 Finally, they found the treasure: working models in the voice improvements branch. \
                 With proper pauses and perfect timing, the engine spoke clearly at last. \
                 Hue and Aye celebrated their victory! The end.";
